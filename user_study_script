// TODO: WRITE SCRIPT FOR VIDEO HERE

// Plot



// VIDEO TIPS:
// add hilarious failures / make it interesting
// SKITS ARE GOOD!!!
// Balance fun with actual knowledge
// Infomercial???
// TITLES!? FOR CLARITY!?
// Show examples of language so viewers know what it looks like
// Show your implementation and design, and a look at the grammar itself


Clarity of Purpose - Skit!!!
*two people sitting on phones*
P1: DANG my IG game is weak AF
P2: Sht dude how many followers?
P1: Only got 3 :'(. I gotta spice up my pictures to stand out but these filters are so original
P2: WHy not use photoshop?
P1: Nah that's some weak sht
P2: Hmmmm maybe I can help
*short clips of P2 creating a python project with our DSL name*
DONE

Effectiveness of the prototype study - Re-enactment / office type skit + narration at end (also office style). Narration over whole clip?
*P1 gives P2 task to do*
*P2 starts doing it but has a confused look on their face whie doing so* P1 looks concerned*
*P2 finishes but the code is all wrong* P1 looks sad*narration of what happened begins*

INTERVIEW
P1 talks to camera about finding


Evidence of use of the prototype study results - interview style
P1 talks to camera about what they did.
*sprinkle in short clips of someone coding*

Effectiveness of end user programmer testing - video footage + integrated office style interview
*roll edited footage of user test*

*INTERVIEW*
P1 talks to camera about what information the users provided and what we did
// TODO: GAVIN WILL DO THIS PART:

Elegance of the language: Narration style with short clips sprinkled / interviews of people using it for ease of use <- re-enactment OR actual footage of user study
    // TODO: NARRATION SCRIPT FOR THESE THREE CASES ALONG WITH CLIPS FOR:
    //                                                                  code snippets LOTS
    //                                                                  user testing comments / clips
    //                                                                  self created user clips if necessary
    ease of use -- appropriate to use case -- is it too tricky for your user type. -
    When designing the grammar we aimed for a language that was simple and easy to learn. We decided to make it very similar to english grammar
    *insert code snippets or someone reading it*.
    flexibility & expressiveness -- how free is the user in what they say? Can they write programs flexibly. - footage of user face expression
    In terms of flexibility we restrict the user by the image processing domain as our language strictly deals with image processing.
    regularity -- language looks aesthetically like a single language, not a couple of languages cobbled together - show footage of language being written
    We created implicit type casting so the user can write as close to english as possible without mixing in syntactic sugar. *insert code here*


Difficulty of implementation - interview reminisce with flashes of acted out frustration / happiness
// TODO: ANDY PROBABLY DOING THIS? WHAT WERE THE ISSUES THAT WE RAN INTO (E.G: DESIGNING A LANGUAGE THAT WAS BOTH STRONG AND FLEXIBLE)
//      example script: "we found that performing advanced tasks lead to a lot of code replication and overall made the code looks ugly,
//                       we used factory, strategy, and interpreter design patterns in order to abstract delocalized code so it would be easy to add and change features.
//                      and took us a few iterations before we could make something that was both flexible and powerful." *insert a clip of someone
//                         coding ferociously then showing team mate and team mate being like wtf and both angry*
*P1 interview begins with a "the good ol days" vibe*
*everytime P1 says something specific on the path (e.g: designing an easy to use grammar was frustarated) act out given emotion
*add music here maybe?*
// TODO: CLIPS REQUIRED: FRUSTARATION (coding intensely, slight pause, GAHHH THROWS LAPTOP ON GROUND), FLEXIBILITY (KINDA LIKE *hmmm i wonder if thisll work...NICE it did cool*),


*ENDSKIT*
P2: Yo look at this sht
P1: DANG this looks lit af! THANKS IMA TRY IT OUT RIGHT NOW
*show P1 doing some coding*
*next day*
*P1 wakes up and checks phone*+100000000 followers WOOT!*
